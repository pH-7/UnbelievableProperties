# Unbelievable Properties

### What is that?

It's a new way to post, promote and find properies.
This is a fun Real Estate ads website that uses Instagram and GeoLocalization for the Property data.
It also doesn't use description for adverts as most people lie when they are writing an advert description.

Finally, please note that for this example, the data is saved in the user's session. For the normal version, it would be used SQLite.

### Why Did you made That?

I made this in 3 hours during a "hack day" organized by my Irish company (yep, you can see that as the code is quite durty! [Uncle Bob](https://cleancoders.com/) would be angry). It was really fun and enjoyed eating Pizzas and drinking beers!
What a fun way to work, isn't it?


### And who made that?

Haha, oh that's me! If you don't know me, my name is **Pierre-Henry Soria** by the way!

### Grant! And can I contact you...?

Sure, my email address are **soria [D0T] pierrehenry [AT] gmail [D0T] com**

Oops, it's just [https://github.com/pH-7](https://github.com/pH-7)!
